# Credit Card Data Analysis Dashboard

This project is a **real-time data analysis solution** using **SQL, Excel, and Power BI**, focused on analyzing credit card transactions and customer data. The dashboards are connected live to the SQL database, so they **automatically update** as new data is added.

## 📊 Project Overview

I developed two interactive dashboards to help analyze and interpret large-scale credit card data:

1. **Credit Card Transaction Report**
2. **Credit Card Customer Report**

These dashboards provide insights into:

* Revenue patterns
* Card usage behavior
* Customer segmentation
* Channel performance (swipe, chip, online)
* Demographic-based analysis

## ⚙️ Workflow & Architecture

* **Excel**: Used for initial data cleaning and formatting.
* **SQL**: Performed data loading, querying, and preparation of datasets for analysis.
* **Power BI**: Visualized the cleaned and structured data; connected to SQL for **real-time updates**.

## 📁 Dashboards Summary

### 🔹 Credit Card Transaction Report

* Revenue and transaction count per quarter
* Expenditure type performance (Bills, Grocery, Travel, etc.)
* Revenue breakdown by **card category**, **job**, **education**, and **chip use**
* Summary of total interest earned and transaction volumes

### 🔹 Credit Card Customer Report

* Customer segmentation by **salary group**, **job**, and **age**
* Revenue by **marital status**, **education level**, and **dependents**
* Top contributing **states**
* Relationship between **income** and **transaction volume**

## 🧠 Key Insights

* **Blue cardholders** generate the highest revenue.
* **Swipe transactions** are the most used, followed by chip and online.
* **Businessmen** and **white-collar workers** are top customer groups in terms of spending.
* Revenue peaks in the **30–40 age group** and among **graduates**.
* States like **TX, NY, CA, FL, and NJ** are major revenue sources.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Microsoft Excel**: Data cleaning, formatting, pre-analysis checks
* **SQL**: Data transformation, filtering, and dynamic loading
* **Power BI Desktop**: Visualization, reporting, and real-time dashboarding

## 📂 Included Files

* `Credit_card_transaction_report.pdf` — Visual report of transactions and card usage
* `Credit_card_customer_report.pdf` — Customer demographics and income analysis

## 🚀 Real-Time Functionality

This is a **real-time dashboard project**. As more data is added to the SQL database, **Power BI automatically refreshes** and reflects the new insights — perfect for continuous business monitoring.
